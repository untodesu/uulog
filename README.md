# :wood: uÎ¼Log
A simple and maybe thread-safe logging library I use across a variety of my personal projects and some projects at work

# HOWTO's
## Copy and forget
- Get a C++20 compiler  
- Copy the contents of `uulog` directory somewhere around your project and make sure your source code can include `uulog.hh`  
- Include `uulog.hh` and register some pre-defined sinks or define and use your own  
- Issue log messages: `LOG_DEBUG`, `LOG_INFO`, `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_ERROR` and `LOG_CRITICAL`  

## CMake: sub-directory
- Clone the repository into your project and remove the sub-repo's `.git` folder  
- Add an `add_subdirectory` call  
- Optionally clean all the unnecessary stuff from both the source tree and CMakeLists.txt  
- Add a dependency on `uulog` library somewhere  
- Include `uulog.hh` and register some pre-defined sinks or define and use your own  
- Issue log messages: `LOG_DEBUG`, `LOG_INFO`, `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_ERROR` and `LOG_CRITICAL`

# Remarks
## Performance impact
**I do not debug with std::format, I do not use print debugging in high call-rate functions, I do not profile a logger. If something runs slow because of a bunch of `LOG_INFO` statements, _I comment them out_**

## Using across different DLLs
- Compile uulog as a shared library via `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`  
- Define `UULOG_DLL` for dependent projects  

## Thread safety
The for-each loop for every `uulog::Sink` registered into the logger is wrapped with an internal mutex (the exact same one used to register and de-register sinks) so the sink is to assume it is safe to access a resource  

## NDEBUG
Whenever `NDEBUG` is defined, the compiled library doesn't provide `uulog::detail::debug` function nor does `LOG_DEBUG` do anything apart from being pre-processed as `((void)0)`
